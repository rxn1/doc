								<h3>How to Use Action Hooks</h3>
								<span></span>
							</div>
							<div class="section-content">
								<p>Usage of action hooks is simple, for example you want to display an advertisement banner after title in single product view, place this code below in your theme's functions.php or create a separate plugin to keep your changes saved when you updates the APS plugin or theme.</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php // display ad banner after title of single product

function mycustom_ad_banner() {
	// your ad banner contents goes here
}

add_action('aps_single_after_title', 'mycustom_ad_banner'); ?&gt;
</pre>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<div class="section">
							<div class="section-head">
								<h3>Templates Customization</h3>
								<span></span>
							</div>
							<div class="section-content">
								<p>You can customize the templates without losing the changes after updates, create a folder in your theme directory, name it "aps", create another folder "temps" inside "aps" folder, copy the template (from "temps" directory of plugin) you want to customize into newly created folder "temps" in your theme.</p>
								<p>Open the copied file in a code editor of your choice, modify the template, if you need to modify files located in "parts" directory of plugin, you have to create another folder inside "temps" folder (in your theme), name it "parts" copy the files and modify as needed.</p>
								<p>We are using a function "aps_load_template_part" to include template parts in templates, you have to supply appropriate parameters to the function or you may include template parts by using "include" function.</p>
								<p>The arguments of "aps_load_template_part" function is as follow.</p>
<pre>aps_load_template_part($slug, $dir, $prams, $once);</pre>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>$slug</strong> (string) the file name with complete path without .php file extension</li>
									<li><strong>$dir</strong> (string) the diectory name in our case is "aps"</li>
									<li><strong>$prams</strong> (array) an associated array of values used in part file</li>
									<li><strong>$once</strong> (boolean) default false, can be true if you want to include the part only once.</li>
								</ul>
								<p></p>
								<p>For example we want to customize the main features of product in single product template, we have to copy aps-single.php template in temps folder of your theme, then copy the "aps-single-features.php" file in "parts" (folder created in your theme) open the "aps-single-features.php" file in a code editor make your changes and save it, <br />
								now open "aps-single.php" file from your theme find the features section and change the parameter of "aps_load_template_part" as follow.</p>
								<pre>aps_load_template_part('temps/parts/aps-single-features', 'aps', $features_params);</pre>
